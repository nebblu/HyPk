# HyPk
Repository for python notebook used in GSM hybrid redshift space power spectrum predictions of  1911.04391 

Simulation data in data/multidark contains measurements made by Hans Winther from https://www.cosmosim.org/cms/simulations/bigmdpl/ multidark simulation

Theory data in data/theory contains data files for power spectra computed using ReACT (nebblu/ReACT git repo). It also contains velocity statistics computed using  a private library for ReACT. Please contact Ben Bose for access. 

Also included is a Mathematica notebook (errors.nb) to compute tthe Gaussian covariance of the redshift space power spectrum multipoles.
