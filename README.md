## MultiDark Data:

> http://www.multidark.org/

Simulation data in data/multidark contains measurements made by Hans Winther from the multidark simulation.

## MultiDark Data:

Theory data in data/theory contains data files for power spectra computed using ReACT. 
> [https://github.com/nebblu/ReACT]
It also contains velocity statistics computed using  a private library for ReACT. Please contact Ben Bose for access. 

## Mathematica notebook:

Also included is a Mathematica notebook (errors.nb) to compute the Gaussian covariance of the redshift space power spectrum multipoles.
